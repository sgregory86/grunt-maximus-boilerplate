var quotes = {
    GLADIATOR: 'My name is Gladiator.',
    ELYSIUM: 'Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops. Imagine where you will be, and it will be so. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you\'re already dead!',
    ROME: 'I\'ve seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark, Rome is the light.'
